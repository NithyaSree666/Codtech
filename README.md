project overview:
This exploratory data analysis (EDA) project involves analyzing a dataset to uncover insights and patterns. It begins with importing necessary libraries and loading the data, followed by assessing its structure and identifying missing values. The project includes univariate analysis through histograms and box plots to explore individual features, as well as categorical analysis with count plots.

Next, it delves into bivariate analysis using correlation heatmaps and pair plots to understand relationships between features. The project concludes with a summary of key findings and insights that could inform future actions or decisions. This structured approach ultimately enhances data understanding and facilitates informed decision-making.
